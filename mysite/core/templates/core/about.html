    <h1>About The Hive 🐝</h1>
    <p>
        The Hive is a community-driven platform built on kindness, cooperation, 
        and the power of shared time. Members exchange services using Beellars — 
        our own time-based community currency.
    </p>

    <p>
        By joining The Hive, you contribute to a system where skills, empathy, 
        and collaboration matter more than money. Together, we create a sustainable 
        network of mutual support.
