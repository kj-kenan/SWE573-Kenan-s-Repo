## 11.2 AI Usage Declaration
I used Cursor, ChatGPT, and Claude extensively throughout the development of The Hive. As someone without a professional software development background and limited prior experience with Django, React, and Python, AI tools were essential to completing this project.
At the beginning of the project, I used AI tools as study partners to learn the fundamentals. I would ask for explanations of concepts, request examples of how things work. During this phase, I was careful to understand each piece of code and learn the underlying principles.
As the project needed to progress faster and the number of required features increased, my reliance on AI tools progressed as well. I used them more for code generation, implementation guidance, and problem-solving. The tools helped me implement features faster than I could have learned to build them from scratch.
Besides coding, I used AI when writing the Software Requirements Specification, AI tools helped me structure the requirements properly and ensure I covered all necessary functional and non-functional requiremetns. Also, I used AI to generate mockup ideas and refine the user interface concepts before implementation. During testing, AI tools assisted in creating comprehensive test cases, identifying edge cases I might have missed, and writing unit tests. For this final report, AI tools helped me organize and present the documentation in a clear, professional format.
I reviewed all AI-generated code to ensure it worked correctly and met the project requirements. I tested each feature thoroughly and made modifications when needed. While I may not have written every line of code independently, I understood what the code was doing and took responsibility for integrating it into a working system.
The final product reflects a combination of AI-assisted development and my own learning, testing, and problem-solving. AI tools enabled me to build a functional system despite my limited programming experience, but all design decisions, feature implementations, and system integration were my responsibility.
