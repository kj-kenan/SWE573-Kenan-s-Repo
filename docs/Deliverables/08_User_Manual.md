# 8. User Manual

This section describes how users interact with The Hive to exchange services using the time-based Beellar system.
## 8.1 Account Registration and Login
Users start by creating an account using a username, email address, and password. After email verification, users can log in to access the platform. Upon first login, each user is assigned an initial Beellar balance, allowing immediate participation in exchanges.

## 8.2 Home
Home page shows the “Honey Map” which is the heart of the website where you can see all the offers and requests and you can filter tag, date and distance. Navigation bar and centered “Create Post” button are also on home page.

## 8.3 User Profile
Each user has a public profile that displays basic information such as bio, interests, and skills. Users can edit their profile information and view other users' public profiles to better understand potential exchange partners.

## 8.4 Offers & Requests
All active offers and requests are displayed on an interactive map using approximate locations for privacy. Users can browse, zoom, and filter posts based on category or distance. Selecting a post reveals detailed information about the service and its owner.

## 8.5 Create Post
Users can create two types of posts:
Offers, representing services they can provide
Requests, representing services they need
When creating a post, users specify a title, description, duration, and approximate location. Posts become visible to other users through the service listings and the interactive map.







## 8.6 Inbox
Inbox is a page where user can see unread messages, pending handshakes and all conversations.

## 8.7 Completing an Exchange and Beellar Transfer
After the service is delivered, both parties confirm completion of the exchange. Once confirmed, the system automatically transfers Beellar credits according to the service duration (1 hour of service equals 1 Beellar). The completed exchange is recorded in both users' transaction history.
## 8.8 Community Interaction Forum
In addition to direct exchanges, The Hive includes a community forum where users can participate in public discussions, ask questions, and interact with other members outside individual service posts.
